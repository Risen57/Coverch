# Coverch
A website to gain info about covid deaths, cases etc about the country you enter.

## Currently Having Some Issues, I'll work on it (maybe). 🤷🏽‍♂️
**Feel free to fork**

It is an update of my [previous covid info app](https://github.com/Risen57/Covid-Searcher/tree/main/covid-fetcher) which was CLI based.

## To use it:
Simply
`git clone https://github.com/Risen57/Coverch.git`
And run it using:
Linux / MacOS:
`python3 app.py`
Windows:
`py app.py`
