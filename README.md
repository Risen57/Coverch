# Coverch
A website to gain info about covid deaths, cases etc about the country you enter.

## Currently Having Some Issues, I'll work on it (maybe). 🤷🏽‍♂️
**Feel free to fork**

It is an update of my [previous covid info app](https://github.com/Risen57/Covid-Searcher) which was CLI based.

## To use it:

Simply<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Risen57/Coverch.git`<br><br>
And run it using:<br>
Linux / MacOS:<br>
`python3 app.py`<br>
Windows:<br>
`py app.py`
